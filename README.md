For the python basic script:
It contains three files that include structures.py,functions.py and functions.py.Structures.py contains a code for checking if a number is even when the user enters any number.Also it has code for generating integers
between 1 and 50 and how to print numbers from 10 to 1.There is an additional function to handle number classification.Functions.py utilizes calculate_area function to calculate area of various shapes 
for example triangles,rectangles and circles.Datatypes.py defines various datatypes in python and converts any datatype of a particular kind eg int to another datatype of another kind. 
For the scientific-computing script:
It has a file start.py that that uses numpy .Numpy is a library for python.
To run these files you write the command python(filename).py

I have learnt how create and add repositories via git and also various datatypes and functions in python.I have learnt the numpy library too.
